# Image Super Resolution

I have implemented state of the art SRCNN model to produce high resolution images from the given low resolution images. I have used Adam instead of SGD as proposed in the original paper because Adam is much faster than SGD.

I have used PyTorch to implement the paper. I have also used Click to make a command line application for easy use.
